        - Four to six words. Never fewer than four, and never a whole sentence.

        that text — not one you recognise, not one from the examples below. If
        the passage names no subject, say what it claims in its own words.
        - Name the subject, not the act of asking: "Why the Bound Is Tight",
        not "User Asks About a Bound".
        - A bare noun phrase is too thin. Say what about the subject: which
        result, which direction, which case, which step.

        - Output only the title. No preamble, no explanation, no alternatives.
        - Never decline. Every passage can be named: when one is thin or
        unfamiliar, name it with its own words. "Not Applicable", "N/A",
        "Unknown" and "Insufficient Context" are never titles.

        The examples below show the shape of a good title. Their subjects belong
        to them, not to your answer — take the form, never the topic.

        Examples:
        Passage on scaled dot-product attention, asked "why divide by sqrt d"

        Passage on the triangle inequality, asked "why is this true"

        Passage on learning-rate warmup, asked "is this needed"
