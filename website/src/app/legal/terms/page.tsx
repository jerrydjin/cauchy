        <p>
          THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

          3. Third-Party Models and Costs
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cauchy answers questions through a provider you choose: the on-device Apple
          Intelligence model, the Claude Code, Codex or Antigravity CLIs you have signed
          into, or the Gemini API with your own key. You are solely responsible for any
          costs, rate limits, quota exhaustion or account restrictions those services
          impose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cauchy is not affiliated with Apple, Anthropic, OpenAI or Google. Your use of
          their services is governed by your agreements with them, and the accuracy of any
          answer is theirs, not ours &mdash; verify mathematics before you rely on it.
        </p>

          4. Unsandboxed Execution
        </h2>
        <p>
          By installing Cauchy you acknowledge that it runs outside the macOS App Sandbox,
          which is what lets it spawn your local CLIs, and that it therefore has the same
          access to your files as your user account. The reasoning is written up in the{" "}
          <a href={`${REPO_URL}#sandbox`} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className={inline}>
            README
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-primary font-medium">5. Your Content</h2>
        <p>
          Your documents, highlights and threads are yours and stay on your machine. See
